	in positionally disordered dipolar materials. Three models distinguished

	to the dipole vector dimensionality and the motion of the medium.
	A physical analysis of our results provides significant insight into

	The resulting general dynamics, which is called intrinsic dynamics
	and by construction treats the evolution of the entire Universe,
	is shown to admit as special cases Newtonian dynamics and Lorentz-invariant
	field theory provided the angular momentum of the Universe is zero
	in the frame in which its momentum is zero. The formal structure
	of Einstein's general theory of relativity also fits the pattern
	of intrinsic dynamics and is Machian according to the criteria of
	this paper provided the so-called thin-sandwich conjecture is generically
	correct.},

	The model is a generalization of the Ising model; and one-, two-,
	and three-dimensional lattices of infinite extent can be extensively
	discussed. A three-dimensional lattice shows ferromagnetic behavior
	and provides a statistical model of the Weiss phenomenological theory.
	The limiting free energy appears in a form which contains two of
	the essential features of the exactly known Ising model results in
	one and two dimensions. This suggests the probable form of the limiting
	free energy for the three-dimensional Ising model. A simplified model,
	the Gaussian model, is briefly discussed because this model also
	contains some of the significant features of the Ising model. However,

	and difficulties arise in defining Burgers circuits and the dislocation
	tensor. The dislocated state may be defined precisely by relating
	the local basis at each point to that of a reference lattice. The
	dislocation density may then be defined; it is important to distinguish
	this from the local dislocation density. The geometry of the continuously
	dislocated crystal is most conveniently analyzed by treating the
	manifold of lattice points in the final state as a non-Riemannian
	one with a single asymmetric connexion. The coefficients of connexion
	may be expressed in terms of the generating deformations relating
	the dislocated crystal to the reference lattice. The tensor defining
	the local dislocation density is then the torsion tensor associated
	with the asymmetric connexion. Some properties of the connexion are
	briefly discussed and it is shown that it possesses that of distant
	parallelism, in conformity with the requirement that the dislocated
	lattice be everywhere unique.},

  journal = {Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering

  abstract = {The concern of this paper is in expanding and computing initial-value
	problems of the form y′=f(y)+hω(t), where the function hω oscillates
	rapidly for ω≫1. Asymptotic expansions for such equations are well
	understood in the case of modulated Fourier oscillators and they
	can be used as an organizing principle for very accurate and affordable
	numerical solvers. However, there is no similar theory for more general
	oscillators, and there are sound reasons to believe that approximations
	of this kind are unsuitable in that setting. We follow in this paper
	an alternative route, demonstrating that, for a much more general
	family of oscillators, e.g. linear combinations of functions of the
	form eiωgk(t), it is possible to expand y(t) in a different manner.
	Each rth term in the expansion is for some ς>0 and it can be represented
	as an r-dimensional highly oscillatory integral. Because computation
	of multivariate highly oscillatory integrals is fairly well understood,
	this provides a powerful method for an effective discretization of
	a numerical solution for a large family of highly oscillatory ordinary
	differential equations.},

  abstract = {A new theory of the class of dilute magnetic alloys, called the spin
	glasses, is proposed which offers a simple explanation of the cusp
	found experimentally in the susceptibility. The argument is that
	because the interaction between the spins dissolved in the matrix
	oscillates in sign according to distance, there will be no mean ferro-
	or antiferromagnetism, but there will be a ground state with the
	spins aligned in definite directions, even if these directions appear
	to be at random. At the critical temperature the existence of these
	preferred directions affects the orientation of the spins, leading
	to a cusp in the susceptibility. This cusp is smoothed by an external
	field. Although the behaviour at low t needs a quantum mechanical
	treatment, it is interesting to complete the classical calculations
	down to t=0. Classically the susceptibility tends to a constant value
	at t=0, and the specific heat to a constant value.},

	by means of non-metric differential geometry is reviewed. We replace
	his definition of the elastic connexion by a more obvious but equivalent
	one. The elastic effect of the inclusion can be represented by extra-dislocations
	whereas the extra-disclination density vanishes, even in the non-linear
	theory. It is shown that the elastic stress of an inclusion can be
	cancelled approximately by an arrangement of lattice dislocations.
	Extra-deformation and extra-dislocation density are specified for
	a simple model of an inclusion having suffered a martensitic transformation.},

	we identify various regimes of finger coarsening over time, the existence

	special relevance to defect formation under stress. The elasticity
	treatment is based on the Green's function solution for a center
	of contraction or expansion in an anisotropic solid. It makes possible
	the precise definition of a formation volume tensor and leads to
	an extension of Eshelby's [Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. A 241 (1226),
	376] result for the work done by an external stress during the transformation
	of a continuum inclusion. Parameters necessary for a complete continuum
	calculation of elastic fields around a point defect are obtained
	by comparing with an atomistic solution in the far field. However,
	an elasticity result makes it possible to test the validity of the
	formation volume that is obtained via atomistic calculations under
	various boundary conditions. It also yields the correction term for
	formation volume calculated under these boundary conditions. Using
	two types of boundary conditions commonly employed in atomistic calculations,
	a comparison is also made of the strain energies of formation predicted
	by continuum elasticity and atomistic calculations. The limitations
	of the continuum linear elastic treatment are revealed by comparing
	with atomistic calculations of the formation volume and strain energies
	of small crystals enclosing point defects.},

	the layer into smaller and smaller pieces. A rectilinear crack pattern
	encodes information about the order of crack formation, as later
	cracks tend to intersect with earlier cracks at right angles. In
	a hexagonal pattern, in contrast, the angles between all cracks at
	a vertex are near 120°. Hexagonal crack patterns are typically seen
	when a crack network opens and heals repeatedly, in a thin layer,
	or advances by many intermittent steps into a thick layer. Here,
	it is shown how both types of pattern can arise from identical forces,
	and how a rectilinear crack pattern can evolve towards a hexagonal
	one. Such an evolution is expected when cracks undergo many opening
	cycles, where the cracks in any cycle are guided by the positions
	of cracks in the previous cycle but when they can slightly vary their
	position and order of opening. The general features of this evolution
	are outlined and compared with a review of the specific patterns
	of contraction cracks in dried mud, polygonal terrain, columnar joints
	and eroding gypsum–sand cements.},

	0°C. They constitute some of the most striking examples of clearly

	the interplay of frost-related physical processes that produce these
	patterns spontaneously and presents unique data documenting subsurface
	soil rotational motion and surface displacement spanning 20 years
	in well-developed circles of soil outlined by gravel ridges. These
	sorted circles are particularly attractive research targets for a
	number of reasons that provide focus for this paper: (i) their exceptional
	geometric regularity captures the attention of any observer; (ii)
	they are currently forming and evolving, hence the underlying processes
	can be monitored readily, especially because they are localized near
	the ground surface on a scale of metres, which facilitates comprehensive
	characterization; and (iii) a recent, highly successful numerical
	model of sorted circle development helps to draw attention to particular
	field observations that can be used to assess the model, its assumptions
	and parameter choices, and to the considerable potential for synergetic
	field and modelling studies.},

	of space, the Helmholtz free energy per particle and the pressure,
	as defined by means of Gibbs configuration integral, are considered.
	A rigorous proof, based only on the consideration of the configuration
	integral, is given for the following well-known thermodynamic properties:
	when N is very large (more precisely tends to infinity), the free
	energy per particle has a finite limiting value, depending on temperature,
	intermolecular forces, specific volume v, but not on the shape of
	D: it is a continuous decreasing function of v, the derivative of
	which exists and defines the pressure; the pressure is a non increasing
	function of v. This confirms the often expressed opinion that a complete
	evaluation of Gibbs integral can never lead to isothermals with loops
	corresponding to metastable states. The assumptions made are essentially
	a positive incompressibility radius of the particles and intermolecular
	forces approaching zero rapidly enough for large separations.},

	their interplay. We identified the strain associated with individual

	and quantified fluctuations at a glass/liquid interface. These examples
	illustrate the wide-ranging and fundamental materials physics that
	can now be studied at atomic-resolution via transmission electron
	microscopy of two-dimensional glasses.},

	liquids with respect to crystallisation; the variation of physical
	properties of supercooled liquids in metastable equilibrium above
	the glass transition; the arrest of structural relaxation at the
	glass transition. The physical significance of computer simulations
	of glass transitions in simple liquids and the question of a hidden
	phase transition underlying an observed glass transition are examined
	critically. In relation to the stability problem, the geometrical
	constraints operative in typical disordered structures, such as random
	sphere packings and random covalent networks, are also discussed.
	A general survey of glass transition phenomena and concepts is presented
	in an introductory section.},

  abstract = {The glass transition refers to the nonequilibrium process by which
	an equilibrium liquid is transformed to a nonequilibrium disordered
	solid, or vice versa. Associated response functions, such as heat
	capacities, are markedly different on cooling than on heating, and
	the response to melting a glass depends markedly on the cooling protocol
	by which the glass was formed. This paper shows how this irreversible
	behavior can be interpreted quantitatively in terms of an East-model
	picture of localized excitations (or soft spots) in which molecules
	can move with a specific direction, and from which excitations with
	the same directionality of motion can appear or disappear in adjacent
	regions. As a result of these facilitated dynamics, excitations become
	correlated in a hierarchical fashion. These correlations are manifested
	in the dynamic heterogeneity of the supercooled liquid phase. Although
	equilibrium thermodynamics is virtually featureless, a nonequilibrium
	glass phase emerges when the model is driven out of equilibrium with
	a finite cooling rate. The correlation length of this emergent phase
	is large and increases with decreasing cooling rate. A spatially
	and temporally resolved fictive temperature encodes memory of its
	preparation. Parameters characterizing the model can be determined
	from reversible transport data, and with these parameters, predictions
	of the model agree well with irreversible differential scanning calorimetry.},

	point stacking faults) in Bravais crystals can mutually convert,
	only theories which comprise these two sorts of defects can be closed
	in the sense of general field theory. Since the pioneering work of
	Kondo and of Bilby, Bullough, and Smith it is clear that differential
	geometry is the appropriate mathematical tool to formulate a field
	theory of defects in ordered structures. This is done here on the
	example of the Bravais crystal, where the above-mentioned defects
	are the only elementary point and line defects. It is shown that
	point defects can be described by a step-counting procedure which
	makes it possible to include also point stacking faults as elementary
	point defects. The results comprise two equations with the appropriate
	interpretation of the mathematical symbols. The point defects are
	step-counting defects and are essentially described by a metric tensor
	g , which supplements the torsion ? responsible for the dislocations.
	The proposed theory is meant to form a framework for defect phenomena,
	in a similar way that Maxwell's theory is a framework for the electromagnetic
	world.},

  abstract = {Chemical oscillating patterns are ubiquitous in geochemical systems.
	Although many such patterns result from systematic variations in
	the external environmental conditions, it is recognized that some
	patterns are due to intrinsic self-organized processes in a non-equilibrium
	nonlinear system with positive feedback. In rocks and minerals, periodic
	precipitation (Liesegang bands) and oscillatory zoning constitute
	good examples of patterns that can be explained using concepts from
	nonlinear dynamics. Generally, as the system parameters exceed some
	threshold values, the steady (time-independent) state characterizing
	the system loses its stability. The system then evolves towards other
	time-dependent solutions (‘attractors’) that may have an oscillatory
	behaviour or a complex chaotic one. In this review, we describe many
	of these pattern types taken from a variety of geological environments:
	eruptive, sedimentary, hydrothermal or metamorphic. One particular
	example (periodic precipitation of pyrite bands in an evolving sapropel
	sediment) is presented here for the first time. This will help in
	convincing the reader that the tools of nonlinear dynamics may be
	useful to understand the history of our planet.},

	fascinated researchers. Turing’s activator–inhibitor principle is
	considered the central paradigm to explain such patterns. According
	to this principle, local activation combined with long-range inhibition
	of growth and survival is an essential prerequisite for pattern formation.
	Here, we show that the physical principle of phase separation, solely
	based on density-dependent movement by organisms, represents an alternative
	class of self-organized pattern formation in ecology. Using experiments
	with self-organizing mussel beds, we derive an empirical relation
	between the speed of animal movement and local animal density. By
	incorporating this relation in a partial differential equation, we
	demonstrate that this model corresponds mathematically to the well-known
	Cahn–Hilliard equation for phase separation in physics. Finally,
	we show that the predicted patterns match those found both in field
	observations and in our experiments. Our results reveal a principle
	for ecological self-organization, where phase separation rather than
	activation and inhibition processes drives spatial pattern formation.},

	general trend that the average distance between a center atom and
	atoms in the first nearest-neighbor shell contracts for several metallic
	melts upon heating. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique
	and molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate that this anomaly
	is caused by the redistribution of polyhedral clusters affected by
	temperature. In metallic melts, the high-coordinated polyhedra are
	inclined to evolve into low-coordinated ones with increasing temperature.
	As the coordination number decreases, the average atomic distance
	between a center atom and atoms in the first shell of polyhedral
	clusters is reduced. This phenomenon is a ubiquitous feature for
	metallic melts consisting of various-sized polyhedra. This finding
	sheds light on the understanding of atomic structures and thermal
	behavior of disordered materials and will trigger more experimental
	and theoretical studies of liquids, amorphous alloys, glasses, and
	casting temperature effect on solidification process of crystalline
	materials.},

  abstract = {Correlations in the atomic structure and dynamics extend in glasses
	and (supercooled) liquids to an intermediate range, which is a few
	times longer than the interatomic spacing. Motion on this length
	scale can be expected to be particularly revealing of collective
	phenomena. However, due to neutron scattering experimental difficulties,
	namely to all-pervasive spurious multiple scattering effects and
	to the weakness of the signal at wave numbers corresponding to this
	length scale, very little is experimentally known so far about the
	dynamics in this range. We have developed a new experimental strategy
	to overcome these difficulties, and applied this novel approach to
	the study of the archetypal fragile glass former CKN. Our results
	provide the first direct experimental evidence for the existence
	of a first, fast structural relaxation step in the supercooled liquid
	phase, which does not scale with the viscosity and which cannot be
	attributed to extra vibrational modes, either propagating or local.
	The enhanced slowing down with decreasing temperature of the slow
	##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/11/10A/031/img1.gif]
	relaxation process in the wave number domain of the intermediate
	range order also allowed us to investigate the temperature dependence
	of the amplitude of this relaxation step in a model independent manner.
	In contrast to some previous findings, our direct results show no
	sign of any critical singularity above the glass transition temperature.},

	simulations, with a particular emphasis on the role of the potential
	energy landscape and of the temperature. At the micrometer scale,
	we present the different mesoscopic models of amorphous plasticity
	and show the relation between shear banding and the type of disorder
	and correlations (e.g. elastic) included in the models. At the macroscopic
	range, we review the different constitutive laws used in finite-element
	simulations. We end with a critical discussion on the opportunities
	and challenges offered by multiscale modeling and information transfer
	between scales to study amorphous plasticity.},

  review = {As they say: The free energy of crystal phases is generally minimized
	by a finite fraction of point defects like vacancies and interstitials.
	However, the equilibrium number of such defects in most colloidal
	and atomic/molecular crystals with a single constituent is extremely
	low. Exemplarily, for the face-centered cubic crystal of hard spheres,
	one of the few colloidal systems where the vacancy and interstitial
	fractions have been calculated, the fraction of vacancies and interstitials
	is on the order of 10-4 and 10-8, respectively, near coexistence
	(1). Are reasons of entropic origin or is it a influence of a free
	surface? In the simulation: is it possible that they just have equilibration
	problem? It clearly shows a single, first-order phase transition
	between a fluid and an ordered phase. The authors of ref. 10 identified
	the ordered phase at coexistence to be a liquid crystal mesophase
	(i.e., a cubatic phase), which is characterized by the presence of
	long-range orientational order along three perpendicular axes, but
	a lack of long-range positional order. (finite size problems) It
	should be noted that because the volume and the number of particles
	in the system are fixed, it is generally not possible to reach an
	equili- brium concentration of defects in the system. However, the
	for- mation of extra layers and lattice distortions both significantly
	increase the number of lattice sites in the crystal, and suggest
	that the thermodynamically stable phase in this regime might be a
	vacancy-rich crystal structure. Thus, yes, can be problems with equilibration.
	The system clearly posesses global vs local frustration: once a crystal
	precursor is formed there is no reason for it to be aligned with
	the sample volume. Thus when it grows and encounters wall the defect
	can form.},

	shape and size evolutions of the nucleus were measured. They deviate

  abstract = {Linear thermal expansions of eight alkali halides have been determined
	at liquid oxygen temperatures and at temperatures from 30 $^\circ$K
	down to 2 $^\circ$K. For temperatures T $\leqslant \theta$/20, where
	$\theta$ is the Debye temperature, the expansion coefficients are
	well represented by $\alpha$ = AT$^3$ + BT$^5$. Values are reported
	for the Gruneisen parameter $\gamma$ = 3$\alpha V$/C$\chi$, where
	C/V is the heat capacity per unit volume and $\chi$ is the compressibility.
	For CsBr (b.c.c. structure) $\gamma$ appears to be nearly independent
	of temperature, with a value of 2.0 but for the other crystals, which
	have the rock-salt structure, the parameter $\gamma$ varies with
	temperature, chiefly between $\theta$/10 and $\theta$/5. At room
	temperature, $\gamma$ lies between 1.45 and 1.7 but at low temperature
	this generally decreases to a value $\gamma_0$ which is ca. -0.1
	for RbI. +0.3 for KCl. KBr and KI and 1.0 for NaCl and NaI; LiF does
	not show this decrease, $\gamma_0$ being 1.7. The values observed
	for $\gamma_0$ are compared with those calculated from elastic constants
	and their pressure derivatives and the general behaviour of $\gamma$(T)
	is observed to conform qualitatively to the predictions of simple
	theoretical models of Born. Blackman and Barron.},

  abstract = {A view is presented of the relation between the continuum theory of
	defects in crystals and the mathematical theory of non-metric, non-Riemannian
	geometry. Both theories are treated in the linear approximation.
	The lattice defects consist of disclinations, dislocations, and extra-matter,
	which are identified with the following three important tensors from
	non-Euclidean geometry: the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor,
	the Cartan torsion tensor and the non-metric Q-tensor. The correspondence
	between the two theories is established by finding a relation between
	the coefficients of linear connection of non-Euclidean geometry and
	the elastic strain, bend-twist, and quasi-plastic strain of defect
	theory. The definitions of the important tensors from non-Euclidean
	geometry then generally correspond to the field equations of defect
	theory. The identities for the curvature tensor generally correspond
	to the continuity equations of defect theory. The relation to the
	conventional formulation of defect theory is pointed out. Two examples
	are given to illustrate the concepts of the paper. One example is
	related to the deformations associated with constant dislocation
	distribution and the other to the deformations of a constant disclination
	distribution.},

	than the fourth-order linear elasticity one, yet its total number
	of symmetry types is larger than the latter and the exact number
	is still inconclusive. In this paper, by means of the irreducible
	decomposition of the linear piezoelectricity tensor and the multipole
	representation of the corresponding four deviators, we conclude that
	there are 15 irreducible piezoelectric symmetry types, and thus further
	establish their characteristic web tree. By virtue of the notion
	of mirror symmetry and antisymmetry, we define three indicators with
	respect to two Euler angles and plot them on a unit disk in order
	to identify the symmetry type of a linear piezoelectricity tensor
	measured in an arbitrarily oriented coordinate system. Furthermore,
	an analytic procedure based on the solved axis-direction sets is
	also proposed to precisely determine the symmetry type of a linear
	piezoelectricity tensor and to trace the rotation transformation
	back to its natural coordinate system.},
